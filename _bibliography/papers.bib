  abstract={The full characterization of the possible transformations of quantum operations is indispensable to developing algorithms in higher-order quantum computation, which is the quantum version of functional programming. Although universal transformations of unitary operations have been well investigated, their extensions to non-unitary operations are still missing, except for a few examples. Here we construct \emph{isometry adjointation} protocols, transforming an input isometry operation into its adjoint operation. This task reduces to the transformation of unitary operation or that of quantum states in special cases. Parallel and sequential isometry adjointation protocols are constructed by transforming unitary inversion protocols using the composition of quantum combs. This construction achieves the optimal approximation error, which implies that the optimal performance does not depend on the output dimension of the isometry operation. In particular, we explicitly obtain the asymptotically optimal parallel protocol achieving the approximation error ε=Θ(d^2/n), where d is the input dimension of the isometry operation and n is the number of calls of the isometry operation. We also construct the protocols for the related tasks called isometry inversion and universal error detection. We conduct semidefinite programming to investigate the optimal performances of the tasks using general protocols including indefinite causal order protocols. The numerical results show that the optimal performances of general protocols do not depend on the output dimension of the isometry operation for isometry adjointation and universal error detection, which is shown analytically for parallel and sequential protocols. They also exhibit the advantage of indefinite causal order protocols over sequential protocols for isometry inversion and universal error detection.},

  abstract={We report a deterministic and exact protocol to reverse any unknown qubit-unitary operation, which simulates the time inversion of a closed qubit system. To avoid known no-go results on universal deterministic exact unitary inversion, we consider the most general class of protocols transforming unknown unitary operations within the quantum circuit model, where the input unitary operation is called multiple times in sequence and fixed quantum circuits are inserted between the calls. In the proposed protocol, the input qubit-unitary operation is called 4 times to achieve the inverse operation, and the output state in an auxiliary system can be reused as a catalyst state in another run of the unitary inversion. We also present the simplification of the semidefinite programming for searching the optimal deterministic unitary
inversion protocol for an arbitrary dimension presented by M. T. Quintino and D. Ebler [Quantum 6, 679 (2022)]. We show a method to reduce the large search space representing all possible protocols, which provides a useful tool for analyzing higher-order quantum transformations for unitary operations.},

  abstract={Isometry operations encode the quantum information of the input system to a larger output system, while the corresponding decoding operation would be an inverse operation of the encoding isometry operation. Given an encoding operation as a black box from a d-dimensional system to a D-dimensional system, we propose a universal protocol for isometry inversion that constructs a decoder from multiple calls of the encoding operation. This is a probabilistic but exact protocol whose success probability is independent of D. For a qubit (d=2) encoded in n qubits, our protocol achieves an exponential improvement over any tomography-based or unitary-embedding method, which cannot avoid D-dependence. We present a quantum operation that converts multiple parallel calls of any given isometry operation to random parallelized unitary operations, each of dimension d. Applied to our setup, it universally compresses the encoded quantum information to a D-independent space, while keeping the initial quantum information intact. This compressing operation is combined with a unitary inversion protocol to complete the isometry inversion. We also discover a fundamental difference between our isometry inversion protocol and the known unitary inversion protocols by analyzing isometry complex conjugation and isometry transposition. General protocols including indefinite causal order are searched using semidefinite programming for any improvement in the success probability over the parallel protocols. We find a sequential "success-or-draw" protocol of universal isometry inversion for d=2 and D=3, thus whose success probability exponentially improves over parallel protocols in the number of calls of the input isometry operation for the said case.},

  abstract={The two classes of membrane transport, namely, secondary active and passive transport, are understood as different reaction pathways in the same protein structure, described by the 16-state model in this paper. To quantify the thermodynamic difference between secondary active transport and passive transport, we extend the second law of information thermodynamics of the autonomous demon in the four-state model composed of two subsystems to the 16-state model composed of four subsystems representing the membrane transport. We reduce the 16 states to 4 states and derive the coarse-grained second law of information thermodynamics, which provides an upper bound of the free energy transport by the coarse-grained information flow. We also derive an upper bound on the free energy transport by the multi-body information flow representing the two-body or four-body correlations in the 16-state model by exploiting the cycle decomposition. The coarse-grained information flow and the multi-body information flows express the quantitative difference between secondary active and passive transport. The numerical analysis shows that the coarse-grained information flow is positive for secondary active transport and negative for passive transport. The four-body correlation is dominant in the multi-body information flows for secondary active transport. In contrast, the two-body correlation is dominant for passive transport. This result shows that both the sign of the coarse-grained information flow and the difference of the four-body correlation and the two-body correlation explain the difference of the free energy transport in secondary active and passive transport.},
